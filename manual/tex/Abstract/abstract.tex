The goal of Lexical Simplification is to replace complex words in texts for simpler, easier to comprehend alternatives. Lexical Simplification can be potentially very useful as a post/pre-processing tool for other text generation tasks, such as Machine Translation and Summarization, and also as an assistive tool for users which may be challenged by complex texts. In this thesis we propose a series of novel contributions for the task. Our main goals are to provide an in-depth analysis of the simplification needs of non-native speakers of the English language, to offer novel, more reliable approaches for Lexical Simplification and also to propose new ways of automatically evaluating Lexical Simplification approaches.
