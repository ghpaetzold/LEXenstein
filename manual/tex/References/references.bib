In this paper, we propose a novel family of kernels which explicitly focus on this type of information. Specifically, after defining a family of tree kernels based on routes between nodes, we present an efficient implementation for a member of this family. Experimental results on four different datasets show that our method is able to reach state of the art performances, obtaining in some cases performances better than computationally more demanding tree kernels.},

abstract = {The exploitation of syntactic structures and semantic back- ground knowledge has always been an appealing subject in the context of text retrieval and information management. The usefulness of this kind of information has been shown most prominently in highly special- ized tasks, such as classification in Question Answering (QA) scenar- ios. So far, however, additional syntactic or semantic information has been used only individually. In this paper, we propose a principled ap- proach for jointly exploiting both types of information. We propose a new type of kernel, the Semantic Syntactic Tree Kernel (SSTK), which incorporates linguistic structures, e.g. syntactic dependencies, and se- mantic background knowledge, e.g. term similarity based on WordNet, to automatically learn question categories in QA. We show the power of this approach in a series of experiments with a well known Question Classification dataset.},

@article{Brysbaert2009,
abstract = {Word frequency is the most important variable in research on word processing and memory. Yet, the main criterion for selecting word frequency norms has been the availability of the measure, rather than its quality. As a result, much research is still based on the old Kucera and Francis frequency norms. By using the lexical decision times of recently published megastudies, we show how bad this measure is and what must be done to improve it. In particular, we investigated the size of the corpus, the language register on which the corpus is based, and the definition of the frequency measure. We observed that corpus size is of practical importance for small sizes (depending on the frequency of the word), but not for sizes above 16-30 million words. As for the language register, we found that frequencies based on television and film subtitles are better than frequencies based on written sources, certainly for the monosyllabic and bisyllabic words used in psycholinguistic research. Finally, we found that lemma frequencies are not superior to word form frequencies in English and that a measure of contextual diversity is better than a measure based on raw frequency of occurrence. Part of the superiority of the latter is due to the words that are frequently used as names. Assembling a new frequency norm on the basis of these considerations turned out to predict word processing times much better than did the existing norms (including Kucera \& Francis and Celex). The new SUBTL frequency norms from the SUBTLEX(US) corpus are freely available for research purposes from http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/supplemental, as well as from the University of Ghent and Lexique Web sites.},

abstract = {Kernel methods in general and support vector machines in particular have been successful in various learning tasks on data represented in a single table. Much 'real-world' data, however, is structured - it has no natural representation in a single table. Usually, to apply kernel methods to 'real-world' data, extensive pre-processing is performed to embed the data into areal vector space and thus in a single table. This survey describes several approaches of defining positive definite kernels on structured instances directly.},

A series of three experiments compared the two syndromes, using the techniques applied by Patterson and Marcel (1977) to adult deep dyslexics, to study a group of 15 boys suffering from developmental dyslexia. Patterson and Marcel's patients were able to perform a lexical decision task but showed no evidence of phonemic encoding of nonwords; our dyslexic children performed this task very slowly and with reduced accuracy but showed clear evidence of phonemic coding of the nonword items. Patterson and Marcel observed that their patients could not read out orthographically regular nonwords; our dyslexic children were able to do this task, although more slowly and somewhat less accurately than their chronological age or reading age controls. Finally, Patterson and Marcel observed that highly imageable words were more likely to be read correctly than words of equal frequency but low imageability; we observed a similar effect in both our dyslexic group and in their reading age controls. This implies that the imageability effect may not be peculiar to dyslexics but may be characteristic of normal reading under certain conditions. It is concluded that developmental dyslexics differ from the patients studied by Patterson and Marcel in demonstrating a pattern of reading which, though slow, is qualitatively similar to the reading of normal readers of a younger age. As such, our results do not support Jorm's position. "

An experimental comparison of various classifier combination schemes demonstrates that the combination rule developed under the most restrictive assumptions-the sum rule-outperforms other classifier combinations schemes. A sensitivity analysis of the various schemes to estimation errors is carried out to show that this finding can be justified theoretically},

abstract = {Convolution tree kernels are an efficient and effective method for comparing syntac- tic structures in NLP methods. However, current kernel methods such as subset tree kernel and partial tree kernel understate the similarity of very similar tree structures. Although soft-matching approaches can im- prove the similarity scores, they are corpus- dependent and match relaxations may be task-specific. We propose an alternative ap- proach called descending path kernel which gives intuitive similarity scores on compa- rable structures. This method is evaluated on two temporal relation extraction tasks and demonstrates its advantage over rich syntactic representations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we provide a study on the use of tree kernels to encode syntactic parsing information in natural language learning. In particular, we propose a new convolution kernel, namely the Partial Tree (PT) kernel, to fully exploit dependency trees. We also propose an effi- cient algorithm for its computation which is futhermore sped-up by ap- plying the selection of tree nodes with non-null kernel. The experiments with Support Vector Machines on the task of semantic role labeling and question classification show that (a) the kernel running time is linear on the average case and (b) the PT kernel improves on the other tree kernels when applied to the appropriate parsing paradigm.},

These texts are usually manually adapted, and teachers say this is a time- consuming and sometimes challenging task. Our goal is the devel- opment of tools to aid teachers by automatically proposing ways to simplify texts. As a first step, this paper presents a detailed analysis of a corpus of news articles and abridged versions written by a literacy organization in order to learn what kinds of changes people make when simplifying texts for language learners.},

@article{Pitt2006,
abstract = {Many models of spoken word recognition posit the existence of lexical and sublexical representations, with excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms used to affect the activation levels of such representations. Bottom-up evidence provides excitatory input, and inhibition from phonetically similar representations leads to lexical competition. In such a system, long words should produce stronger lexical activation than short words, for 2 reasons: Long words provide more bottom-up evidence than short words, and short words are subject to greater inhibition due to the existence of more similar words. Four experiments provide evidence for this view. In addition, reaction-time-based partitioning of the data shows that long words generate greater activation that is available both earlier and for a longer time than is the case for short words. As a result, lexical influences on phoneme identification are extremely robust for long words but are quite fragile and condition-dependent for short words. Models of word recognition must consider words of all lengths to capture the true dynamics of lexical activation.},

Our proposed approach subsumes a general framework for word-similarity, and in particular, provides a flexible way to incorporate distributed representations. Using vector representations, such an approach captures both distributional semantic similarities amongwords as well as the structural relations between them (encoded as the structure of the parse tree). We showan efficient formulation to compute this kernel using simple matrix operations. We present our results on three diverse NLP tasks, showing state-of-the-art results. 1},

However, the traditional syn- tactic tree representation is often too coarse or ambiguous to accurately capture the semantic relation information between two entities. In this paper, we propose a new tree kernel, called feature-enriched tree kernel (FTK), which can enhance the traditional tree kernel by: 1) refining the syntactic tree representation by annotating each tree node with a set of dis- criminant features; and 2) proposing a new tree kernel which can better measure the syn- tactic tree similarity by taking all features into consideration. Experimental results show that our method can achieve a 5.4\% F-measure im- provement over the traditional convolution tree kernel. 1},

@article{Zhou2007,
abstract = {This paper proposes a tree kernel with context- sensitive structured parse tree information for re- lation extraction. It resolves two critical problems in previous tree kernels for relation extraction in two ways. First, it automatically determines a dy- namic context-sensitive tree span for relation ex- traction by extending the widely-used Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (SPT) to include necessary context information outside SPT. Second, it pro- poses a context-sensitive convolution tree kernel, which enumerates both context-free and context- sensitive sub-trees by considering their ancestor node paths as their contexts. Moreover, this paper evaluates the complementary nature between our tree kernel and a state-of-the-art linear kernel. Evaluation on the ACE RDC corpora shows that our dynamic context-sensitive tree span is much more suitable for relation extraction than SPT and our tree kernel outperforms the state-of-the-art Collins and Duffy’ s convolution tree kernel. It also shows that our tree kernel achieves much bet- ter performance than the state-of-the-art linear kernels . Finally, it shows that feature-based and tree kernel-based methods much complement each other and the composite kernel can well integrate both flat and structured features.},

@article{Zhu2010,
abstract = {In this paper, we consider sentence simplification as a special form of translation with the complex sentence as the source and the simple sentence as the target. We propose a Tree-based Simplification Model (TSM), which, to our knowledge, is the first statistical simplification model covering splitting, dropping, reordering and substitution integrally. We also describe an efficient method to train our model with a large-scale parallel dataset obtained from the Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia. The evaluation shows that our model achieves better readability scores than a set of baseline systems.},
